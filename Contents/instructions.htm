<p><b>Installation Instructions</b><img border="0" src="../thermometers-large.png" width="436" height="420" align="right"></p>
<p>This Widget will install and run on your Windows XP/Win7 system and the 
thermometers will return valid temperatures. Although this version of the widget 
will install on Mac OS/X it will not return any valid temperature information. A 
later version of the widget will work on Mac OS/X operating system. </p>
<p>This widget uses Speedfan to obtain temperature information. Why is Speedfan 
needed? The answer is that the Windows operating system is meant to provide an 
interface to the motherboard and other components to provide system temperature 
information. Unfortunately, Windows does not yet do its job as there seems to be 
no stable hardware specification for hardware manufacturers to provide&nbsp; 
temperature sensors. All the hardware manufacturers do their own thing. The end 
result is that it is impossible for a widget to get the temperatures from all 
the myriad different types of PC components in the world, so we have to resort 
to third party applications that can do it pretty well. The best of the bunch is 
a good piece of software called Speedfan. Speedfan is pretty good at extracting 
temperatures for almost all PC hardware so it is a fundamental requirement for 
Speedfan to be installed on your Windows PC for this widget to function. </p>

<pWhen the widget starts up it attempt to find the speedfan installation 
folder. If it finds it on c:, d: or e: in the \program files or \program files 
(86) then it will restart Speedfan automatically. If Speedfan is not found then 
the widget will suggest that you enter the location of the program. It will also 
flash the central speedfan indicating lamp in red. Speedfan's location can be 
checked at any time by right clicking on the widget and selecting &quot;widget 
preferences&quot; then look at Speedfan Settings. If the location is already entered 
then don't change it.</p>
<p><b>Startup</b></p>
<p>On Windows XP Speedfan will be started and minimised straight away. On Win 
7/Vista you may have to minimise it manually the first time it runs. This is due 
to the bug where NT6 restricts access to Speedfan's installation folder. When Speedfan is started by the widget there will be a wait for 15-20 seconds 
whilst Speedfan interrogates all the sensors. When this is done it will start to 
show the temperatures.</p>
<p><b>Instructions for use</b></p>
<p>The temperatures of your CPU/GPU are indicated by the level of the red 
alcohol (or mercury) on each thermometer. The maximum temperature reached by the 
thermometer is shown by the metal index that floats above the mercury level. 
Click and slide to reposition it.</p>

resized. It can now be made significantly smaller than the standard large size 
and it looks rather sweet in small form. Not everything will work after a 
resize though! The widget can only be resized at the back end in Widget

<p><b>Sensor Selecting Menu</b> </p>
<p>
<img src="http://lightquick.co.uk/images/stories/menu.png" alt="menu.png" title="menu.png" style="float: left; margin: 5px; width: 144px; height: 251px;" height="251" width="144">
</p>
<p>If you perform a right click on the widget it will pop up a drop down menu. 
The menu is context-sensitive so if you right click when on the thermometer body 
more options will appear. These are the alternative sensors that can be used by 
the thermometer. By default one of the sensors will be selected by the program 
logic that determines the best one to use. </p>
<p>Typically, a number of sensors are shown, the image to the left shows some 
typical sensors: </p>
<p>Sensor 1 GPU sensor (assuming Nvidia)<br>
Sensor 2-3 Hard discs (assuming 2 hard discs)<br>
Sensor 4 Temp 1 - unidentified functioning ACPI sensor (probably motherboard)
<br>
Sensor 5 CPU core 1<br>
Sensor 6 CPU core 2 (could be as many as four)<br>
Sensor 7 GPU sensor read through Nvidia control panel (should be the same as 
sensor 1)<br>
Sensor 8 unidentified non-functioning sensor </p>
<p>The menu allows you to select any sensor manually by clicking and selecting 
the sensor of choice. </p>

</p>
<br>
&nbsp;<p>As the widget cannot yet determine the name of the sensor from the 
information provided by speedfan you'll need to change the thermometer title 
yourself. This is the title at the top of the thermometer. Simply right-click
<img src="http://lightquick.co.uk/images/stories/cputext.png" alt="crank.png" title="crank.png" style="float: left; margin: 5px; width: 24px; height: 11px;" height="11" width="24">on 
the title and you will be presented with a drop down that allows you to select 
from a list the appropriate sensor titles. Note: this just changes the name, 
nothing else, it does not select a different sensor. Use the <b>Sensor Selecting 
Menu</b> above to do that. </p>

Run-time Problems</b> </p>
<p>On Windows XP - the widget can determine the sensor names and will return the 
correct temperature for CPU and GPU. However, on NT6 systems (win 7 and Vista) 
the temperatures returned will initially be that of the GPU and one other 
'unknown' sensor. The widget will do its best to determine the correct one. 
However, we cannot currently guarantee it is the CPU temperature as NT6 does not 
allow you to read the Speedfan installation folder where the information is 
stored. Also, due to the nature of the Speedfan API, Speedfan does not return 
the names of sensors but only the temperature values. This is really annoying as 
it means we cannot be sure which temperature we are returning. At the moment the 
widget will do its best to guess and in any case the widget gives you the 
functionality to decide which sensor to use. In the long term the developer of 
Speedfan will almost certainly be making changes to improve his program and 
enable the above functionality. We will just have to wait a while longer until 
he does this. Sorry! </p>
<p>I really hope you enjoy this widget, a lot of work has gone into it and it 
has given me great pleasure to provide a Steampunk widget that would be usable 
to a lot of other people. I don't ask for donations but can I please ask you to 
leave some positive feedback at yahoo widgets? This widget will be live on Yahoo 
widgets soon and I will post the link here shortly. </p>
